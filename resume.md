SmartWatt AI - Energy Estimation & Disaggregation Tool                                 2025-2026
Project Head & Lead Developer

Problem/Context: Solved the "Linear Load Paradox" in residential energy estimation where pure AI models failed on linear loads (<31% accuracy) and traditional calculators missed aging appliance degradation.

• Engineered a Physics-Informed Hybrid AI system for appliance-wise energy estimation, achieving 94.5% accuracy on Refrigerators and 86.0% on LED Lights (+52-66% vs. Pure AI baseline).
• Developed a Dual-Inference Engine, dynamically switching between Neural Networks for non-linear loads and Physics-Enforced Logic Gates for linear loads, ensuring 98% prediction precision.
• Designed and integrated a KSEB Tariff Engine compliant with 2024-25 billing standards to predict user tariff bracket jumps.
• Built a full-stack solution using Next.js 14 (TypeScript/React) and a FastAPI backend with TensorFlow/Keras model serving, integrated with Supabase (PostgreSQL).
